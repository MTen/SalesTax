X UserInput takes initial input and checks it for glaring errors (null, non-string entry) if passes sets input to UserInput OBJECT
	
X InputParser ABSTRACT_OBJECT_OR_METHOD takes each line from UserInput OBJECT and puts it into an UserInput.inputArray ( .split(\n))

X Have: Array of Strings
X InputMatcher evaluates each index of inputArray (loop)


X create a Batch object and put a new Transaction object for each 
	
CALCULATOR_OBJECT looks at each Transaction object from the Batch Object, calculates the price based on keywords. 
	//Add 0% Tax to Transaction object starting out
	//Gets the Batch.transactions ArrayList
	//evaluates IF the name matches the items in a case statement
		// Imported + 5%
		// Not Medical, book, food keywords + 10%
	
	
Batch Object is printed out for user.

Problem Two: Sales Taxes
 
Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are exempt. 
Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.
 
When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax), 
finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales taxes paid.  
The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.
 
Write an application that prints out the receipt details for these shopping baskets.
